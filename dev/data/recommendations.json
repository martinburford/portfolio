The project was very time critical, and I have to say that, <em>hands down, Martin is one of the best Developers I have encountered</em>. For me, <em>he shattered the idea that some people have about contractors where they do not care about the projects they are working on</em>. He was more involved and interested in the project than people who were actually fully employed on the project. He is a highly skilled Developer who never takes a back seat or cannot be bothered to help, explain or fix an issue. He is a very detailed person who doesn't crack under pressure and <em>he knows how to explain something so that everyone understands</em> (be it on a ticket or verbally). He also takes the time to make sure that the same point of view is reached by all in the end. <em>He has some of the cleanest code I have ever come across</em>. Couple this with the high level of details he provides in Jira tickets, and it made checking and testing a breeze. <em>Working with Martin was a joy</em> not only because he was a devoted worker who gave his time for anybody that needed it, but also due to the fact that <em>he is a very interesting and fun person with a lovely personality that made it a treat to be around</em>. I truly hope to work alongside him again. Highly recommended for any type of project, big or small."
