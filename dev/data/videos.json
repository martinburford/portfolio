In working alongside a couple of very talented developers, and a supporting team of designers and UX staff, we managed to deliver something pretty amazing, taking into account the time we had available. The concept was to allow a user to submit URLs, which proved that 2016 wasn't all bad news, and that some of the things that happened over the course of the year were incredible and heart-warming. URLs provided were then scraped, tidied up a bit, and adapted into a more digestible format for the site we were building. The rendered output was <em>a very rich interface</em>, <em>fully responsive</em>, with animations primarily becoming active as elements of the page came into view. I built features such as <em>advanced lazyloading</em>, all <em>custom animations</em>, <em>infinite page scrolling</em>/loading, URL submission, <em>Captcha validation</em>, along with many more.",

The site comprised of approximately <em>125 pages and approaching 100 unique components</em>. Due to the browser/device requirements, and a lack of browser support, I was unable to use CSS media queries. As a result, I opted to use the Adapt.js responsive framework. The website designs required both visual and functional differences between the different render modes (mobile and desktop), so I built an extensive framework to compliment Adapt, in order to activate and de-activate significant areas of site functionality when switching between device resolutions. This was coupled with <em>13 unique colour themes throughout the site</em>, a combination of website section themes and corporate brand colours. These themes were made possible via a comprehensive use of CSS specificity. All JavaScript was built into a number of namespaces, built to work alongside jQuery, with functionality such as carousels built via bespoke jQuery plugins in order to deliver against the exact project requirements. Also whilst at VML, I was asked to implement a solution for another client, Premier League, whereby <em>SVG graphing</em> tracked the progress of teams throughout the football season. This was something that had been a pending piece of work for around 18 months at the time, and was something I was able to complete in just a single day, delighting their client.",

The full-screen site required the building of a complete <em>timelining JavaScript framework</em>, allowing for a Flash-esque timeline and queuing mechanism, along with being dynamic in its ability to <em>render in 1 of 4 different languages</em>.
