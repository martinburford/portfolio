	"summary": "I worked at R/GA on a complex HTML and JavaScript (jQuery) build which is a functional set of administration screens to a nationwide touchscreen in-store system for Nokia. Architecture-wise, <em>.net 4 MVC</em> was used, and I was responsible for creating all of the front-end development, whilst working with the lead .net developer to ensure simple <em>front-end to back-end integration</em>. I wrote 6 bespoke jQuery plugins, enabling both optimal code and ease of extensibility in the future, combined with <em>progressive enhancement</em> and complete browser consistency.",

He has a really good understanding of how the web works, and that allows him to build complex platforms at the highest standards. It has been <em>very straightforward to integrate the front-end that he has been in charge of</em>, with the back end code of the application, his advice and documentation to make integration smoother have been great. I look forward to work with him again!"

		"jobTitle": "Executive Producer",
		"recommendation": "Martin has recently worked on a large Retail project at R/GA and has been in charge of all the front end (user interface) programming for a bespoke Admin Tool that's been created as part of the project. Due to very tight deadlines the project requires a great deal of autonomy and initiative from all team-members and Martin has been the ideal person to have on such a project. <em>He's super-good at what he does</em>, has a logical approach to his work that ensures that you get correct outcome even if you're not managing and reviewing his work on a frequent basis, which has been vital to our progress and success for us. Martin also finds great solutions, <em>understands the user-perspective really well and is a perfectionist<?em>, so what you get in the end will work, it will be intuitive and it will look nice too! I think I'll want Martin on all my projects of this type in the future!"
