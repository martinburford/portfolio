	"summary": "I worked on 2 fairly similar projects during my 4 months at Profero. Both were extremely rich (in functionality) responsive front-end websites, built to work across desktop, mobile and tablet using a combination of HTML4/5, CSS 2/3 and JavaScript. The first site was designed and built as a <em>full-screen immersive user experience</em>, whereas the second was restricted and governed by a Sharepoint set of templates, running at fixed-width dimensions. Both were built 100% by me from scratch through to completion. The full-screen site required the building of a complete <em>timelining JavaScript framework</em>, allowing for a Flash-esque timeline and queuing mechanism, along with being dynamic in its ability to <em>render in 1 of 4 different languages</em>. The fixed-width site was more of a scroll site, albeit with gesture based alternatives for mobile and tablet switched in at appropriate times.",

		"recommendation": "Martin worked with us on three challenging projects as a front end developer. <em>His work was excellent and he always added massive value</em>. Martin has excellent attention to detail and always strives for the best possible final product. He naturally added polish to everything he worked on. I can not recommend Martin enough, without doubt he is <em>one of the best front end developers I have worked with in the last 14 years</em>. It would be a pleasure to work with him again."

		"name": "Kelly Barker",
		"jobTitle": "Senior Project Manager",
		"recommendation": "Martin came in as a freelancer to help out on a project and certainly did that. Martinâ€™s technical ability, passion and willingness to get stuck in make working with Martin easy and enjoyable. Martin is <em>always striving to create the best work</em> and his proficient way of working allows this to happen. <em>He has great attention to detail</em> and is a great problem solver, explaining his process and decision making alone the way, giving everyone involved the understanding and confidence needed to get the project done. I couldn't recommend Martin enough and will certainly be trying to snap him up when I need more freelance cover."
