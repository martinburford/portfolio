	"summary": "I was hired by Sapient to work on the front-end element of an internal Christmas project. The timeframes were extremely tight, and the hours were long. In working alongside a couple of very talented developers, and a supporting team of designers and UX staff, we managed to deliver something pretty amazing, taking into account the time we had available. The concept was to allow a user to submit URLs, which proved that 2016 wasn't all bad news, and that some of the things that happened over the course of the year were incredible and heart-warming. URLs provided were then scraped, tidied up a bit, and adapted into a more digestible format for the site we were building. The rendered output was <em>a very rich interface</em>, <em>fully responsive</em>, with animations primarily becoming active as elements of the page came into view. I built features such as <em>advanced lazyloading</em>, all <em>custom animations</em>, <em>infinite page scrolling</em>/loading, URL submission, <em>Captcha validation</em>, along with many more.",

The best thing he does is the notes he writes for the whole days activities which gives a very detailed picture of all of his amazing work. He <em>helped fellow colleagues on numerous occasions</em>. I have found out that <em>he is an expert in JavaScript, HTML5 and responsive web development</em>. I can simply say \"Martin knows his stuff!!!\""
