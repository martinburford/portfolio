I built this from scratch within 2-3 days, and was inclusive of full \"no JavaScript\" support, as well as <em>full multi-gesture support</em>, for the scrolling between different slides. In addition to this work, there were also a number of other templates which required building, for content population by the internal team after I finished.",
