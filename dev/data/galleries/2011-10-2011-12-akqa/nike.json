	"summary": "I worked at AKQA on a large project for one of their biggest clients, Nike, focusing on a <em>complex mapping implementation</em>. This involved latitudinal and longitudinal projections to enable <em>dynamic tile loading</em> via cached webservices. The main reason for this was because the mapping application was expected to receive around <em>100,000+ marker points</em>, which quite obviously couldn't all be added to a single map instance at once. I wrote all the JavaScript through a number of custom Nike namespaces to allow a huge number of configurable variations of just how (and more importantly, when) different geolocational datasets were appended to the map.",
