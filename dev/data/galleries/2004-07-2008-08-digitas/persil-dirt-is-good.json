	"summary": "At Digitas, my role varied greatly from day to day. With extensive front-end and back-end development experience along with <em>team management</em> skills, I was involved in the majority of technology-based client work that Digitas did. This typically ranged from general management of an entire project to full CMS builds to <em>multi-lingual xml</em>-based flash integrations. All work in this role (subject to client requirements) met \"AA\" <em>W3C WAI compliancy</em> regulations utilizing CSS2, and where applicable, CSS3. All layouts were 100% relative, were stringently built to be <em>fully cross-browser</em> between PC and Mac web browsers, and were always coded highly semantically. Towards the end of my contract, the role shifted somewhat to more of a <em>leadership</em> position with direct line management of a number of technical staff along with being the figurehead in the organization for ensuring consistently high quality code production via a number of means, one of which being regular code reviews.",
