As a result, Martin left a stable and well documented system which met all of our functional and non-functional requirements. Wouldn't hesitate in hiring him again!"

		"jobTitle": "Technical Director",
		"recommendation": "We required a developer to come in at short notice and hit the ground running on a challenging project, and Martin was a great choice for this. He worked well alongside the team, proactively suggesting new approaches where appropriate, but being pragmatic and conscious of the constraints of deadlines and budget also. Our project was quite complex and <em>required an expert in JQuery, which Martin undoubtedly is</em>. His expertise was invaluable as was his ability to accurately predict the amount of time required for a particular workload, making allocation of resources, and project management, much simpler."
