	"summary": "I was hired by Somo to work on a greenfield project which focused on building a tool enabling a website to be constructed from scratch, from a collection of custom written re-usable React components. These components could then be edited and configured in a variety of different ways. On top of this, a range of themes, layouts, templates, fonts etc. were also created, in order to offer yet more customization options to each unique website.",

Martin joined the project mid-way through, and <em>had no problem in quickly getting himself up to speed on the work required of him</em>. More than that though, from my point of view as a ScrumMaster, <em>I was very impressed</em> with how Martin always made sure to keep me up to date with the status of his work and any impediments he could foresee that I could help to remove. In my opinion, <em>Martin is a dedicated and thorough developer</em>, and I would be more than happy to work with him again in the future!"
