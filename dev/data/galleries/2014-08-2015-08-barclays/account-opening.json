	"summary": "I worked at Barclays on <em>a front and back-end component library</em>, built via a combination of <em>custom templates and a JSON configuration engine</em>. My responsibility related to the complete ownership of the JavaScript controller and the interactive functionality of all individual components. In addition to that, I also <em>wrote the projects entire set of GruntJS automation scripts</em>, enabling full sites (consisting of hundreds of pages) to be compiled in a matter of seconds. For the 12 months I spent at Barclays, I played a lead role in the team overseeing all aspects of the overall front-end development.",

		"recommendation": "Martin is one of the best Front-end Developer I have met so far in my entire career. <em>His passion for quality is absolutely mind blowing</em>. He is always looking to improve his standards not just to satisfy his own quest but also to go above and beyond the project brief. I have worked with Martin in two companies - Sapient Nitro and at Barclays Design Office most recently. At Barclays, we were doing some challenging work that needs a lot of patience and in-depth knowledge of coding for the mobile web. Martin as always found creative ways to work with the existing code, not throwing away the work that has been done by existing developer community. He had found ways to <em>clean the existing code and bring the development team to a much higher standard</em>. I will always look forward to working with him not just on official projects, but also on personal projects. <em>If I were to have an 'A' team for any of my work, the first person I'd get in touch with for front-end coding and UI development would be Martin</em>."

		"name": "Richard Locke",
		"jobTitle": "Front-End Developer",
		"recommendation": "I worked with Martin for several months at Barclays. If you want someone who does not shy away from a challenge, then Martin is that someone. He learnt GruntJS whilst working alongside me. As soon as he had grasped the concepts of how Grunt worked, he then went on to come up with a great solution using it. <em>One thing is for certain, Martin knows JavaScript. There is not much about JavaScript he does not know</em>. All of his code is clean and consistently formatted with meaningful comments throughout. Using his attention to consistency, Martin helped bring that to the team along with some more advanced coding concepts. He also managed to bring his JavaScript coding consistency and best practices to Sass/Scss. Whilst we worked together, <em>Martin also helped mentor a junior member of the team</em>, imparting his knowledge and experience.His vast experience and exposure to technology is something that would benefit any team Martin is part of. I would definitely work with him again if our paths crossed. Highly recommended."

I had the pleasure of working with Martin (again) at Barclays where he supported me and delivered on a complex multi-faceted design and development project for the past year. He also showed me technical leadership, planning and mentoring qualities. <em>He has a calm persona about him</em>. I find him very approachable and highly engaging. On top of all that he's witty, loves a terrible pun and my dad jokes. He's an alright fella in my book and would love to work with him again...soon"

Martin deservedly has a reputation in the industry as an excellent front end developer and from our first conversation, it was clear that he was more than capable of delivering. <em>He continually impressed</em> from interview through to his last day working there and <em>I've received excellent feedback for him</em>. I'd highly recommend him!"

He will be missed."
	},{
		"name": "Anastasija Krysa",
		"jobTitle": "Lead UX Designer",

He was brought into the project to make sure that journeys designed by UI/UX team would look and work responsively across different devices and operating systems. He was mainly involved in developing a responsive component library that was to be used accross key areas of Barclays website and applications. From the very beginning of our work together Martin was very helpful with many useful suggestions and out of the box solutions for the project. His key strengths are - <em>impressive development skills</em>, knowledge of the latest web trends, problem-solving, pro-actively offering solutions, bringing creative ideas to the table, adapting to fast changing situations and being adept at all aspects of communications. <em>I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Martin for a Lead Developer role</em>."

Unusually, given his seniority, Martin is also flexible in his approach and will work in whatever way a project demands.Martin is highly self-motivated and left alone he will burn through work at a terrific rate. In fact <em>you will need a small team to create enough work for him</em>! If you have a world-class project then you need <em>a world-class developer like Martin</em>.
