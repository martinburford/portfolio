	"summary": "I was hired by Stink Digital to build a <em>YouTube channel</em> for their client, Sonar. Sonar is an annual multi-day music festival, in 2012, taking place in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The requirement from Stink was to build the channel in <em>3 separate languages</em>, English, Portugese and Spanish. Many of the components I built for this project were <em>XML driven</em>, at the request of Stink, along with a number of custom written jQuery plugins and a significant language translation engine I bespoke wrote, to work alongside the Python and AppEngine back-end.",
