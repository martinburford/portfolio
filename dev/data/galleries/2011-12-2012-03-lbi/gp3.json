	"summary": "I was hired by LBi to work on quite a few different projects. This included building a number of interactive, <em>webservice driven</em> image galleries, with both left-to-right and full <em>right-to-left support</em>. On another client, FOM, I was asked to build some of the more complex elements to the GP2 and GP3 motorsport series websites. This functionality involved intricate <em>countdown timers</em>, catering for all associated timezones, offsets, UTC vs GMT and so on. Finally, I built the entire front-end framework for a tablet-focused site for Barclays, which formed their main UK .co.uk website.",

		"recommendation": "I had the pleasure of working with Martin for just over 3 months on a technically challenging, multi-platform development project. Martin joined as the lead Interface Developer, managing a team of 4. <em>The breadth and depth of Martin's technical skills were hugely valuable</em> to the team that he lead as well as the Java developers that used the QA approved code that Martin and his team produced. This was of particular benefit on this specific project due to the broad range of devices and browsers within the approved matrix. The project that we worked on a time sensitive and <em>Martin worked extra hours, both in to the night and weekends to ensure that tight deadline was adhered to</em>. Although Martin worked extra hours, the quality of his output did not drop. Martin took extra time to ensure that all of the code provided by the team was of the required standard and fit for purpose. Martin's <em>excellent attention to detail and analytical approach</em> provided clarity in structure that will ensure that <em>the project is extensible and adaptable in future iterations</em>. This robust approach will stand the permanent development team, and therefore the client relationship, in good stead for many months to come. If the chance rose again, <em>I would not hesitate in re-hiring Martin</em>. I hope our professional paths cross again in the not too distant future."

		"recommendation": "Martin was recommended by the technical lead on the project. At the time we were struggling for time and <em>when Martin came in he made an immediate impact to the project</em>. He worked on a JavaScript heavy component of the GP2 and GP3 sites; <em>he didn't struggle at all where previous developers did</em>. He showed superior knowledge of JavaScript and <em>tremendous work ethic in order to get the job done</em>. He was passionate for this project and he went that extra mile, which for a freelancer is rare. Without doubt I would recommend Martin as a solid senior front-end developer."
