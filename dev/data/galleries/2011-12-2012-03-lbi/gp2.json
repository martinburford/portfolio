	"summary": "I was hired by LBi to work on quite a few different projects. This included building a number of interactive, <em>webservice driven</em> image galleries, with both left-to-right and full <em>right-to-left support</em>. On another client, FOM, I was asked to build some of the more complex elements to the GP2 and GP3 motorsport series websites. This functionality involved intricate <em>countdown timers</em>, catering for all associated timezones, offsets, UTC vs GMT and so on. Finally, I built the entire front-end framework for a tablet-focused site for Barclays, which formed their main UK .co.uk website.",

He worked on a JavaScript heavy component of the GP2 and GP3 sites; <em>he didn't struggle at all where previous developers did</em>. He showed superior knowledge of JavaScript and <em>tremendous work ethic in order to get the job done</em>. He was passionate for this project and he went that extra mile, which for a freelancer is rare. Without doubt I would recommend Martin as a solid senior front-end developer."
