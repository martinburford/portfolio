	"summary": "I returned to Trinity Mirror to work on <em>a huge greenfield project (circa 60+ sites)</em>, helping with the overall architecture and development of the new digital platform for a company with <em>monthly traffic levels in the tens of millions</em>. The development teams technical stack comprised of full <em>native JavaScript using Express on Node</em>, alongside the templating language of <em>Jade</em>, which was used to translate the back-end data layer into both front-end components and pages.

The project was spread across 10 teams of 10 individuals each, where 2 week sprints, inclusive of 2 releases per week were <em>implemented in an Agile way</em>.",
