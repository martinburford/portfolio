	"summary": "My role at Lloyds was based on Strong Customer Authentication. Due to regulatory requirements, new methods need to be added to numerous banking platforms in order to support an increased level of security to the login process. I worked for 6 months in the role taking the WIP from a minimal MVP to a fully functional suite of components published across 2x separate private ECMA Script modules. There were many other areas to this project, including (but not limited to) the creation of a React component styleguide, a recursive screenshot generator via a headless browser, an Excel to JSON export utility and programmatically generated (interactive) SVG flows charts.",

When required, <em>Martin also delivered bespoke solutions</em> to address specific project challenges like copy management and prototype archiving. <em>The quality of his documentation</em> and his ability to keep the team up to date about the state of the codebase were equally <em>impressive</em>."

Very <em>committed and reliable</em>, he's someone that will <em>get the job done efficiently, neatly, with a lot of care for the detail</em> but above all, very well thought through so it's <em>really well documented and well tested</em> making collaboration a seamless part of the agile workflow"

He is <em>extremely knowledgeable in what he does</em> and also has the added bonus of writing code in the best way for the end user too, which is a rare talent amongst developers in my experience. <em>He is tenacious and hard working</em> in his approach to work and I <em>found him very easy to work with</em>. I really enjoyed working with Martin and would welcome the opportunity to work with him again in the future."
