	"summary": "Autoquake are the UKs biggest online retailer of used cars, and hired me to enable their existing platform to be able to support <em>white-labelling</em>, allowing for the underlying architecture and functionality to be easily and cost-effectively rolled out to partnering suppliers of cars. The role, recently completed, enabled Autoquake to offer clients the ability to operate standalone versions of their ecommerce platform, branded to meet any design. Technically, this was possible via a highly configurable <em>Spring and JSTL back-end</em> along with a strongly architected front-end allowing for <em>visual and functional theme switching</em>. My 3 month role at Autoquake involved rebuilding the core Autoquake platform from scratch (http://www.autoquake.com), along with the creation of their first white-labelled site, for their client, ALD (http://ald.autoquake.com).",
