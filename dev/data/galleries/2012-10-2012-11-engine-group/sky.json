He is a 'real developer' coding from scratch when needed in a fraction of the time it takes most developers and to <em>a quality Tech directors can only dream of</em>. Martin studied at St Martins, so has a creative eye, yet has an incredible technical brain, can communicate like 'normal people' explaining very technical 'stuff' in a way anyone can understand - just some of the the myriad of reasons that make him one of the best front end devs around. The work speaks for itself & so do his recommendations (& the people who recommend him)."
