	"summary": "I worked at The Mill in London for 3 months, helping out their digital team with a couple of websites for their client, Acer. These sites were both <em>multi-lingual</em>, built to work in over <em>35 unique languages</em>. I was responsible for writing the entire code structure of the sites, inclusive of all CSS, HTML, JavaScript, along with the framework to perform the translation capabilities. The HTML5 version of the site included a huge level of fully bespoke written animation wrapped into a number of JavaScript namespaces and custom jQuery plugins.",
