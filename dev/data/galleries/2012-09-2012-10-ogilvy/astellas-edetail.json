	"summary": "I was hired by Ogilvy Action originally to build a highly interactive JavaScript website from scratch. That was cancelled on my first morning, so I ended up working on lots of bits and pieces for around 2 months. This included a <em>HTML5 LocalStorage reporting framework</em>, a bespoke PhoneGap iPad app from the ground up as well as creating a new eDetail iPad platform, with some fairly significant <em>CSS3 flip effect</em> functionality.",
