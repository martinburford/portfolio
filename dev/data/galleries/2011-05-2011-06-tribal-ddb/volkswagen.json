	"summary": "I spent just under a month at Tribal building a highly interactive JavaScript overlay widget for the existing Volkswagen UK website, which offers the functionality of <em>booking a testdrive</em> from a range of different VW cars/models. Functionality was also built to support <em>real-time</em> (closest) dealer lookups as well as reservation slots in order to make the user experience as easy and interactive as possible.",

		"recommendation": "Martin is <em>a talented and self motivated individual</em>. While working with Martin I was able to experience first hand his focused development and ability to explore the problem space. He was able to rapidly develop a solution and refine it to meet the current requirements."
	},{
		"name": "Chris Haslam",
		"jobTitle": "Recruiter",
		"recommendation": "Martin not only helped us deliver for one of our biggest clients but did it before schedule, to <em>a much higher standard then most would</em> and stayed in contact throughout the process. <em>It is very rare to find all of these qualities in one of your candidates</em>. If you do, rule of thumb is to make sure he doesn't need to work for anyone else. I lost that battle and am truly disappointed. I would hire Martin again without a seconds thought..."
