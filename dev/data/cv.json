						"text": "I started coding professionally in 1999, and have a deep passion for beautifully crafted web interfaces. My approach to work is always the same. I am driven by working with nice, smart people. I’m incredibly passionate about how the mechanics and visuals of a website work together in harmony, resulting in a stunning user experience. Yes, I code HTML, JavaScript, ES6, Node, SASS etc in every contract, but my true passion is in building the very best UI a website can have, with whatever technologies are required to do the job. Couple this with an obsessive side to my personality where I continually strive for the cleanest, most extendable and robust code possible. I work hard to ensure I only ever leave companies with code that I myself would be happy to inherit. If you wish to discuss potential contract roles with me, then ",

Whilst I'm studying, I am also happy to look at the possibility of starting a new Front-End development contract position. So please get in touch if you have anything which you think may be of interest."
