						"text": "I started coding professionally in 1999, and have a deep passion for beautifully crafted web interfaces. My approach to work is always the same. I am driven by working with nice, smart people. I’m incredibly passionate about how the mechanics and visuals of a website work together in harmony, resulting in a stunning user experience. Yes, I code HTML, JavaScript, ES6, Node, SASS etc in every contract, but my true passion is in building the very best UI a website can have, with whatever technologies are required to do the job. Couple this with an obsessive side to my personality where I continually strive for the cleanest, most extendable and robust code possible. I work hard to ensure I only ever leave companies with code that I myself would be happy to inherit. If you wish to discuss potential contract roles with me, then ",

Whilst I'm studying, I am also happy to look at the possibility of starting a new Front-End development contract position. So please get in touch if you have anything which you think may be of interest."

More than anything, I am grateful for Martins ability to take on a brief and deliver quality results. I had to oversee a few other projects at the same time, so I wasn't always present, but I knew that I could trust Martin with whatever task he'd get. He is perfectly able to work independently and will make sure to eliminate any wrong assumptions or ambiguities. This is really important in my opinion. Likewise he is also a great sport when working in a team, and <em>he was always happy to help any of the other team members</em>. Martin is a top professional.

The project was very time critical, and I have to say that, <em>hands down, Martin is one of the best Developers I have encountered</em>. For me, <em>he shattered the idea that some people have about contractors where they do not care about the projects they are working on</em>. He was more involved and interested in the project than people who were actually fully employed on the project. He is a highly skilled Developer who never takes a back seat or cannot be bothered to help, explain or fix an issue. He is a very detailed person who doesn't crack under pressure and <em>he knows how to explain something so that everyone understands</em> (be it on a ticket or verbally). He also takes the time to make sure that the same point of view is reached by all in the end. <em>He has some of the cleanest code I have ever come across</em>. Couple this with the high level of details he provides in Jira tickets, and it made checking and testing a breeze. <em>Working with Martin was a joy</em> not only because he was a devoted worker who gave his time for anybody that needed it, but also due to the fact that <em>he is a very interesting and fun person with a lovely personality that made it a treat to be around</em>. I truly hope to work alongside him again. Highly recommended for any type of project, big or small."
